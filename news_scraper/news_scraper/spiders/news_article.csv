Hanna Ziady,2024-09-02T15:32:27.250Z,Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers.,CNN,"London CNN — Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers. In a statement Monday, the German automaker, one of the world’s biggest car companies, said that it could not rule out plant closures its home country. Other measures to “future-proof” the company include trying to terminate an employment protection agreement with labor unions, which has been in place since 1994. “The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. “The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness. Volkswagen, which embarked on a €10 billion ($11.1 billion) cost-cutting effort late last year, is losing market share in China, its single biggest market. In the first half of the year, deliveries to customers in that country slipped 7% on the same period in 2023. Group operating profit tumbled 11.4% to €10.1 billion ($11.2 billion). The lackluster performance in China comes as the company loses out to local EV brands, notably BYD, which also pose an increasing threat to its business in Europe. “Our main area of action is cost cutting,” Blume told analysts on an earnings call last month, citing planned reductions to factory, supply chain and labor expenses. “We have done all the organizational steps needed. And now it is about costs, costs and costs,” he added.

Associated Press,2024-09-02T15:59:35.088Z,"Linda Deutsch, a special correspondent for The Associated Press who for nearly 50 years wrote glittering first drafts of history, died Sunday. She was 80.",CNN,"Los Angeles AP — Linda Deutsch, a special correspondent for The Associated Press who for nearly 50 years wrote glittering first drafts of history from many of the nation’s most significant criminal and civil trials — Charles Manson, O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson, among others — died Sunday. She was 80. Deutsch was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2022 and underwent successful treatment, but the cancer returned this summer. She died at her Los Angeles home, surrounded by family and friends, said nurse Narek Petrosian of Olympia Hospice Care. AP chief United Nations correspondent Edith Lederer was among those with Deutsch at the end. They were friends for more than 50 years and trailblazing female reporters when they joined AP in the late 1960s. “She was an incomparable friend to hundreds of people who will miss her wit, wisdom, charm and constant inquisitiveness,” Lederer said. One of America’s best-known trial reporters when she retired in 2015, Deutsch’s courts career began with the 1969 trial and conviction of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. She went on to cover a who’s who of criminal defendants — Manson, Simpson, Jackson, Patty Hearst, Phil Spector, the Menendez Brothers, “Night Stalker” Richard Ramirez, “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski and the police officers charged in the beating of motorist Rodney King. She was in a Los Angeles courtroom in 1995 for the conclusion of “The Trial of the Century” that saw Simpson, an NFL Hall of Famer, acquitted of killing his ex-wife and her friend. Thirteen years later, Deutsch was in a Las Vegas courtroom when Simpson was convicted of kidnapping and robbery and sentenced to prison. “When a big trial loomed, AP’s assignment editors didn’t have to ask who should get the assignment. No, the instant question was, ‘Is Linda available?’” recalled Louis D. Boccardi, who served as AP’s executive editor for a decade and as president and CEO for 18 years. “She mastered the art of celebrity trial coverage and, in the process, became something of a media celebrity herself.” For decades, Deutsch covered every appeal and parole hearing of each convicted Manson Family member. Other historic moments included witnessing the 1976 conviction of Hearst, the newspaper heiress found guilty on bank robbery and other charges; the 2005 acquittal of Jackson on child molestation charges; and the 2009 murder conviction of Spector, the famed music producer. “Linda was a fearless reporter who loved being on a big story — and she indeed covered some of the biggest,” said Julie Pace, AP’s executive editor and senior vice president. “She was a true trailblazer whose command of her beat and tireless work ethic made her an inspiration to so many journalists at the AP and across our industry.” Linda Deutsch, right, the designated court pool reporter, presents the media with the pool report of a visit to the home of music producer Phil Spector in August 2007 in Alhambra, California. Damian Dovarganes/Pool/Getty Images Her work, always written with verve, was not limited to celebrity — other trials involved fraud, conspiracy, environmental disasters and immigration — and eventually earned her the title of special correspondent, the most prestigious byline for an AP reporter. Defense attorney Thomas Mesereau, who represented Jackson, called Deutsch “the epitome of ethics and professionalism in journalism.” “I can’t think of anybody who rises to her level,” he said of Deutsch when she retired. Deutsch was just 25 when she covered the conviction of Sirhan. She then turned to the bizarre case of Charles Manson, a career criminal who had reinvented himself as a hippie guru, proselytizing and furnishing psychedelic drugs to a group of disaffected youth. The Manson Family, as they came to be known, terrorized Los Angeles on successive summer nights in 1969, breaking into homes in two wealthy neighborhoods and killing seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate. Most victims were stabbed multiple times, and their blood was used to scrawl “pig” and other words on the walls of the homes. When Manson and three of his young female followers went on trial for murder in 1970, they turned the monthslong legal proceeding into a “surreal spectacle,” as Deutsch would write when Manson died in 2017. “People were having LSD flashbacks in the courtroom and at one point Charlie is leaping across the counsel table at the judge with a pencil in his hand and the girls are jumping up and down singing,” Deutsch recalled during a 2014 interview. With only one significant trial under Deutsch’s belt, the AP initially sent a more experienced reporter from New York to lead its Manson trial coverage. After a month of witnessing such antics, he returned home in disgust, leaving Deutsch in charge. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is really something,’” Deutsch remembered with a laugh. “I didn’t know trials could be like this.” Nonetheless, she was hooked, forming tight bonds with the journalists who showed up every day for nine months. But an even bigger trial, born in the modern television era, would eclipse Manson more than two decades later. When Simpson, one of America’s most beloved celebrities and sports figures, was charged with fatally stabbing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in a fit of rage, news outlets from all over the world sent reporters to cover the case. The judge made Deutsch, by then a familiar face around the courthouse, the only reporter to cover jury selection. She became ubiquitous on television, telling a worldwide audience what was going on in the courtroom. After Simpson was acquitted 11 months later, he called to thank her for what he considered fair and objective coverage. The conversation led to what would be the first of a number of exclusive interviews he gave her over the years. Not all her trials involved celebrities. Deutsch spent five months in Alaska covering the trial of Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that caused one of the worst US environmental disasters when it spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in 1989. She was also at the 1973 espionage trial of Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked to The New York Times the top secret Pentagon Papers that revealed unsavory details about US involvement in Vietnam. The Times published a series of articles about the contents that helped turn the public against the Vietnam War. Deutsch covered the trial of Ramirez, the “Night Stalker” serial murderer, listening to testimony so gruesome it brought tears to the eyes of reporters. But it was the 1992 trial of four Los Angeles police officers who were videotaped beating King that shook Deutsch the most. Their acquittals triggered rioting in Los Angeles that killed 55 people and caused $1 billion in property damage. “That almost destroyed my belief in the justice system,” she said in 2014. “I feel a jury usually gets it right, but in that case, no. It was the wrong conclusion. It was the wrong verdict and it nearly destroyed my city.” Like so many others, Deutsch fell in love with Los Angeles after moving there from somewhere else. Born and raised in New Jersey, she traced her interest in journalism to age 12, when she founded an international Elvis Presley fan club newsletter in her hometown of Perth Amboy. The lifelong Presley fan traveled to the musician’s Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2002 to cover the 25th anniversary of his death. By her sophomore year at New Jersey’s Monmouth College — now Monmouth University — she had landed a part-time job at her hometown newspaper, where she persuaded her editor to allow her to travel to Washington, DC, in 1963 to cover the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech. Arriving in Southern California after graduation, she worked briefly for the San Bernardino Sun before joining the AP in 1967. Deutsch initially aspired to be an entertainment reporter and, for years, would take time off from the court beat to help cover the Academy Awards. In 1975, after the fall of Saigon ended US involvement in Vietnam, she was sent to the Pacific island of Guam to interview evacuees and help get locally hired AP staffers safely to the United States. But it was always the drama of the courtroom that called her home. “It’s as old as Shakespeare and as old as Socrates,” she said in a 2007 interview. “It’s an extremely powerful theater that tells us about ourselves and about the people on trial. And I think it’s ever fascinating.” Deutsch’s survivors include Marvin Sosna, an uncle Deutsch credited with influencing her to become a journalist; cousins Elaine Deutsch, Lisa Deutsch and Lana Sternberg; and godson Luke Rattray. Funeral arrangements were pending.","Linda Deutsch, AP trial writer who had a front row seat to courtroom history, dies at 80",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/media/linda-deutsch-veteran-ap-writer-dies/index.html
Chris Isidore,2024-09-01T15:00:19.536Z,"Boeing has experienced all manner of bad news in the last six years, and almost nothing but problems. Later this month it could add a strike by 32,000 workers to its list of woes. ",CNN,"New York CNN — Boeing has experienced all manner of bad news in the last six years, and almost nothing but problems. Later this month it could add a strike by 32,000 workers to its list of woes. The contract between Boeing and the International Association of Machinists is due to expire at 11:59 pm PT on September 12. Without a new contract, the workers who build its planes in Washington state are set to start the first strike at the company in 16 years. And right now, the chances of a deal don’t look good, according to the head of the union local. “We’re far apart is on all the main issues — wages, health care, retirement, time off,” Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, told CNN this past week. “We continue to work through that, but it’s been a tough slog to get through.” It’s just the latest in a series of serious and high-profile problems at a company that has dealt with fatal crashes traced to a design flaw in its best-selling jet, accusations that it put profits and production speed ahead of quality and safety, tanking aircraft sales, an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges that it deceived regulators, and massive financial losses covered by soaring levels of debt. Both sides say they want to reach a deal without a strike. But the anger of rank-and-file union members over recent contract concessions and difficulties at the once-proud company could make reaching that deal in the short time remaining a tall order. The launch of Boeing’s long-delayed 777X aircraft has encountered another problem, forcing the company to pause testing and dealing yet another blow to Boeing's reputation. CNN’s Tom Foreman reports. Clipped From Video video Related video Boeing pauses tests of its troubled 777X after it found structural problems “We continue to bargain in good faith as we focus on the topics that are important to our employees and their families,” said a statement from Boeing. “We’re confident we can reach a deal that balances the needs of our employees and the business realities we face as a company.” But Holden said that any deal that can win the support of the rank-and-file needs to recapture some of the concessions the union gave up in two previous agreements since 2008. Both those talks were contract extensions, rather than negotiations for new deals. And in both cases the union felt forced to agree to concessions, including increased payments by members for health insurance and the loss of traditional pension plans, or risk losing thousands of jobs. Boeing was threatening to build nonunion facilities to handle the production of the 737 Max and the 777X. Boeing, which has one non-union 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina, dropped plans to move production of the Max and 777X after the labor deals were reached. New CEO started just last month Boeing goes into these talks with a brand new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who started the job on August 8. He issued a statement that he wants to “reset our relationship” with the union after meeting with Holden and other union leadership in his first week on the job. But Holden said he has not seen any differences in Boeing’s stance at the bargaining table. Ortberg’s predecessor, former CEO Dave Calhoun, also told investors in July that Boeing’s intention is to avoid a strike and seemed to signal it’d be willing to pay what it takes to avoid a work stoppage.

So, we’re just going to work as hard as we can not to have a strike.” The company said that wages for IAM members have increased 60% over the last 10 years due to general wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments and incentive pay. But the union is still angry over the earlier concessions. It is also seeking improved time off and also better job guarantees so it won’t be faced once again with the threat of losing work to nonunion plants. “We cannot go through another period where a year or two from now where our jobs are threatened,” Holden said, Numerous unions, including the Teamsters at UPS and the United Auto Workers union at GM, Ford and Stellantis, won double-digit wage increases in recent union deals. But in those and many other cases, they were negotiating with companies making record profits and with plenty of resources to satisfy union demands. By contrast, the problems at Boeing have resulted in $33.3 billion in core operating losses over the course of the last five years, forcing the company to go deeply into debt. It is in danger of having that debt downgraded to junk bond status, but Holden insists that the union still has leverage in these talks. Strike would have a broad impact Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major force in the US economy and shutting it down will have a wide-ranging impact. Beyond the 32,000 union members out of the nearly 150,000 US employees, the company estimates its own economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. But perhaps more importantly, Boeing is one of only two major suppliers of commercial jets to the airline industry. And the industry is already dealing with Boeing’s delayed deliveries that can’t be ramped back up until it addresses questions about the safety and quality of its planes. “They haven’t said they can’t afford our proposals,” he said. “They are reasonable. We’re in a tough position because of decisions they made to keep increasing the dividend and share repurchases, cutting R&amp;D. They’ve been paralyzed to launch a new airplane. It’s because of those decisions and the crashes that we’re in this position.” One of the union’s bargaining goals is to get a union representative on the Boeing board of directors, which has faced harsh criticism for the company’s many problems. “The board certainly deserves to be criticized,” Holden said. “We don’t want to run the company. But we want to make sure our voices are being heard about the decisions being made. We love the Boeing Company. It’s the people on the board who don’t. They sacrificed its integrity.”","Boeing’s next big problem could be a strike by 32,000 workers",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/business/boeing-strike-threat/index.html
