            Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers.
    

    
            In a statement Monday, the German automaker, one of the world’s biggest car companies, said that it could not rule out plant closures its home country. Other measures to “future-proof” the company include trying to terminate an employment protection agreement with labor unions, which has been in place since 1994.
    

    
            “The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. “The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness.
    

    
            Volkswagen, which embarked on a €10 billion ($11.1 billion) cost-cutting effort late last year, is losing market share in China, its single biggest market. In the first half of the year, deliveries to customers in that country slipped 7% on the same period in 2023. Group operating profit tumbled 11.4% to €10.1 billion ($11.2 billion).
    

    
            The lackluster performance in China comes as the company loses out to local EV brands, notably BYD, which also pose an increasing threat to its business in Europe.
    

    
            “Our main area of action is cost cutting,” Blume told analysts on an earnings call last month, citing planned reductions to factory, supply chain and labor expenses. “We have done all the organizational steps needed. And now it is about costs, costs and costs,” he added.

            Volkswagen’s cost-cutting plans will face heavy resistance from labor representatives, which hold almost half the seats on the company’s supervisory board, the body that appoints executive managers.
    

    
            IG Metall, one of Germany’s most powerful unions, on Monday blamed mismanagement for the firm’s shortcomings and vowed to fight to protect jobs.
    

    
            “Today, the board presented an irresponsible plan that shakes the very foundations of Volkswagen, massively threatening jobs and locations,” IG Metall lead negotiator Thorsten Groeger said in a statement.
    

    
            “This approach is not only short-sighted but also highly dangerous — it risks destroying the heart of Volkswagen… We will not tolerate plans that the company makes at the expense of the workforce.”
    

    
            Volkswagen employs almost 683,000 workers worldwide, including some 295,000 in Germany, according to its most recent earnings report.
    

    
            Thomas Schaefer, the CEO of Volkswagen passenger cars, said the company remains committed to Germany “as a business location.” He added that VW would initiate talks with employee representatives urgently to explore possibilities for “sustainably restructuring the brand.”
    

    
            “The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures,” Volkswagen said.

         — 
    


    
            A Texas judge late last month struck down a nationwide ban on noncompete agreements that was supposed to take effect this Wednesday.
    

    
            Existing noncompete agreements will therefore now remain in place. And employers may still ask you to sign one as a condition of employment. That is, unless and until a higher court decides otherwise, or Congress passes a law prohibiting it. But, if that does happen, it could take years.
    

    
            In the meantime, if you’re working under a noncompete agreement — or are considering signing one — here’s what you need to know and do, because in some cases the agreement may not be enforceable.
    

  
        1. Understand what your noncompete requires


    
            Generally speaking, noncompetes prohibit you from working for your employer’s competitors within a given geographic distance for a given period of time. For example, you may be prohibited from working for a competitor within 50 miles of your current job for a year after leaving.
    

  
      
            
        
      
    
       
    
    
    
      
        
  
  Signage is seen at the Federal Trade Commission headquarters in Washington, DC, August 29, 2020.

            So, understand exactly how you will be constrained when you leave your current job — whether you quit, get laid off or are fired for cause — and what, if anything, you are getting in exchange for signing away your right to work where you wish.
    

    
            Also understand how the location of competitors is defined, because the agreement might preclude you from working at a company within a given distance not just from your own work site, but also that of your company’s satellite locations.
    

    
            “Read your agreement. You’d be surprised how many people don’t,” said Michael Fiffik, managing partner of Pennsylvania-based Fiffik Law Group PC. His law firm also provides services through LegalShield, which connects people with lawyers in their state to advise them on their noncompete agreements and other matters at little to no charge when they sign up for a monthly plan that costs just under $30 and can be canceled at any time.
    

    
            Also, when considering whether to sign a noncompete, “think about it in the context of your career path,” Fiffik suggested. By that he means if it’s typical in your line of work to move up by moving on every few years, signing a noncompete might be problematic. 
    

    
            And, in general, everyone should review the paperwork they signed when they took their job, because they may not even be aware they signed one, said Donna Ballman, an employee-side employment law attorney in Florida and author of “Stand Up For Yourself Without Getting Fired.”
    

    
            “Some (noncompete provisions) are disguised as a ‘confidentiality agreement’ or ‘bonus agreement,’ or even (may appear) in job applications. Most people sign that giant stack of paperwork they get at the beginning of their employment without reading it carefully,” Ballman wrote in an email to CNN.
    

  
        2. Find out if your state restricts noncompetes


    
            The state where you’re working may impose restrictions or outright bans, which may render your noncompete invalid. Start by checking online with your state’s labor department and the state’s attorney general. This interactive map, from the Economic Innovation Group, also provides a quick rundown of current state restrictions and bans.
    

    
            For instance, in California, two new laws went into effect reiterating and making plain what has been true since the 1800s: Noncompetes are, with few exceptions, unlawful and unenforceable, according to Robert Ottinger, founder of Ottinger Employment Lawyers.
    


    
    

    
    





                    




    
        
                
      
    
       
    
    
    
    


        
    


                    
                        
  
    Video Ad Feedback

                                04:18
                            
                             - Source:
                CNN
    
                    
                


    
            That includes anyone in California who is employed by a company headquartered elsewhere or whose job is relocated to California. “The minute you set foot in California, [the noncompete agreement] evaporates,” Ottinger said, even if it says it is subject to the laws of another state.
    

    
            In New York, many agreements are unenforceable because they don’t meet the multipart test the state requires of such agreements to be valid, including not imposing undue hardship on an employee. In Ottinger’s experience, “there’s a 90% or higher chance of it being invalid. … If you take it before a judge, the judge will not enforce it,” he said. That is especially the case for low- and mid-level workers, he added. “We’ve had dog walkers and sandwich makers subject to them. We win almost every time.”
    

    
            By contrast, many other states impose far fewer restrictions. And some, like Kansas and South Carolina, impose none at all, according to the Economic Innovation Group.
    

  
        3. Even absent state restrictions, antitrust laws still apply


    
            Even where workers are least protected by state law, you still may have recourse if you feel your noncompete agreement is egregious.
    

    
            “Federal and state antitrust law still applies, so it’s still illegal to have a noncompete agreement for the purpose of preventing competition. Employers must have a legitimate interest to protect, such as protecting confidential information or trade secrets, customer goodwill, extraordinary or specialized training the employer provided, or special relationships with customers developed as a result of the employment,” Ballman said.
    

    
            And the Federal Trade Commission, which created the now struck-down rule banning noncompetes, notes that it is not prevented from “addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.”
    

    
            Ballman said that there are some defenses against a noncompete that most states will recognize. “These include where the employer breaches the agreement first, where there is no legitimate interest to protect other than preventing competition, where the length of time or the scope is overbroad, or where public health or safety would not be served.”
    

    
            And there may be other ways to prove your noncompete is illegitimate, especially when the employer indicates that it is intended to protect confidential information. For instance, Ballman said, “many employers don’t actually take measures to protect that so-called confidential information. If it’s on the website, if they allow some employees to compete but not others, if they brag about customers on social media, then there’s a great argument that the information isn’t confidential after all.”
    

    
            All that said, “there’s no magic wand to get out of these,” she added. So, knowing what you’re getting into before signing anything and consulting with a knowledgeable employee-side employment attorney in your state may save you a lot of time and stress when you do eventually move on to a new job.

            Disney on Sunday pulled its ABC stations, ESPN and other cable networks from DirecTV’s lineup as the two companies failed to reach a new distribution deal, leaving millions of sports fans in the dark as the college football and NFL seasons get underway.
    

    
            The expiration of an agreement between the two companies led to Disney-owned networks going dark for more than 11 million satellite subscribers ahead of Sunday night’s kickoff between the USC Trojans and LSU Tigers, midway through the US Open tennis tournament and days before the NFL season opener.
    

    
            “The Walt Disney Co. is once again refusing any accountability to consumers, distribution partners, and now the American judicial system,” Rob Thun, chief content officer at DirecTV, said in a statement. “Disney is in the business of creating alternate realities, but this is the real world where we believe you earn your way and must answer for your own actions. They want to continue to chase maximum profits and dominant control at the expense of consumers - making it harder for them to select the shows and sports they want at a reasonable price.”

            While the standoff knocked ESPN and Disney-owned ABC affiliates off the nation’s third largest pay TV provider, it also forced other networks to go dark on the service, including FX, National Geographic and Freeform.
    

    
            “DirecTV chose to deny millions of subscribers access to our content just as we head into the final week of the US Open and gear up for college football and the opening of the NFL season,” Disney Entertainment chiefs Dana Walden, Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement. “While we’re open to offering DirecTV flexibility and terms which we’ve extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and programs. We urge DirecTV to do what’s in the best interest of their customers and finalize a deal that would immediately restore our programming.”
    

    
            As negotiations between the two parties stretched on, Disney offered DirecTV a sports-centric package that included ESPN networks and ABC sports broadcasts, as well as a selection of Disney’s linear channels paired with some of the entertainment giant’s direct-to-consumer services, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

            Disney emphasized that the rates they’re requesting from DirecTV are in line with those of other providers and reflect the value of its entertainment portfolio. A Disney spokesperson said DirecTV had sought “unreasonable” discounts. But DirecTV said that Disney had demanded that to reach a deal, the carrier must waive all future legal claims that its behavior is anti-competitive.
    

    
            The collapse of the talks comes as satellite and cable providers seek skinnier and more flexible bundles from programmers that could allow for more affordable options for consumers seeking a smaller selection of channels.
    

    
            “Unfortunately, while [direct to consumer] offerings have evolved, pay TV packages have remained largely unchanged,” Thun said in an open letter ahead of the deal’s collapse. “Instead of allowing distributors like DirecTV to also develop smaller, more tailored packages at prices that reflect the value they get from the content, programmers have continued to impose and enforce strict bundling requirements through exorbitant minimum penetration rates – the minimum proportion of a distributor’s subscribers required to access a channel.”
    

    
            The stalemate comes as media giants look to muscle up their streaming arms, with Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company), Paramount and others increasingly airing premium shows on their own digital services, forgoing traditional cable and satellite distribution and its tens of millions of subscribers.
    

    
            “Consumer frustration is at an all-time high as Disney shifts its best producers, most innovative shows, top teams, conferences, and entire leagues to their direct-to-consumer services while making customers pay more than once for the same programming on multiple Disney platforms,” Thun said in his statement Sunday. “Disney’s only magic is forcing prices to go up while simultaneously making its content disappear.”

            Last year, Disney renewed a distribution deal with Charter, avoiding a last-minute blackout of “Monday Night Football” after the cable provider demanded greater flexibility in its bundles and access to Disney’s streaming services. While the showdown briefly resulted in Disney-owned channels being pulled from Charter’s Spectrum service over Labor Day weekend, Disney ultimately agreed to a deal that offered Charter subscribers access to its Disney+ and ESPN+ services.
    

    
            Legacy media companies have been working for years to transition away from relying on the traditional cable bundle and toward streaming services as millions of consumers cut the cord each year, a migration prompted by the rapid rise of Netflix. Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the launch of a forthcoming sports-focused joint streaming venture from Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corporation, dealing a major blow to the effort.
    

    
            The decision came after Fubo, a smaller rival sports streaming service, alleged in a lawsuit that the trio were attempting to leverage their sports media rights to edge out competitors, cornering the market in a single, anticompetitive bundle.

      New York
      CNN
         — 
    


    
            More than 10,000 hotel workers at 24 hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike early Sunday morning, disrupting travel during a busy Labor Day weekend.
    

    
            The hotels are reportedly still open but guests will deal with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services. UNITE HERE, the union representing the striking workers, says they are striking not just for better pay but also better working conditions, including the return of automatic daily room cleaning that many hotels dropped during the pandemic.
    

    
            “We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of UNITE HERE, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
    

    
            Aissata Seck, a banquet food server who has worked at Hilton Park Plaza in Boston for 18 years, said her rent has increased from $1,900 to $2,900 in the last five years. “My pay only covers my rent,” she told CNN. She is now working as an Uber driver to make ends meet.
    

    
            Apple Ratanabunsrithang, a cook at Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, told CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that she “has to work two jobs to survive in the city,” and while wages are important, so is keeping health care benefits. “The majority of people that work and are in the union are long established — they’ve worked 10, 20, 30 years. So their whole life is working at a hotel, which is physical work, so the health care is very important,” she said.
    

    
            Mills told CNN that the lack of daily room cleaning not only costs jobs for her union’s members — reducing housekeeping employment by nearly 40% — but it also increases a cleaning staff’s workload, since it requires tending to rooms that haven’t been cleaned for a number of days.
    

    
            The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,000 rooms between them in the cities of Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
    

    
            The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Baltimore, Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
    

    
            Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
    

    
            Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
    

    
            These strikes are set to end after three days, as occurred in Los Angeles’ work stoppage. The union has yet to determine whether or not they will return on a rolling basis as they did in Southern California last year, Mills told CNN on Friday ahead of the strike deadline. A return of rolling strikes has not been ruled out.
    

    
            The union eventually reached deals for all but three of the hotels they had targeted, but those agreements weren’t reached until earlier this year.
    

    
            This has been a particularly busy Labor Day weekend for travel with AAA expecting a 9% increase in domestic travel compared to last year and the Transportation Security Administration expecting record passenger screenings at US airports.

            Baltimore hotel workers are joining a massive nationwide strike against three major hotel chains during one of the biggest travel holidays of the year.
    

    
            Unite Here, the union representing hotel workers, said approximately 200 hotel workers walked off the job in Baltimore at the Hilton Inner Harbor this morning.
    

    
            Hotel union workers are now on strike across 25 US cities. More than 10,200 hotel workers at dozens of hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike early Sunday morning.
    

    
            “I walked out today because we just cannot keep working paycheck to paycheck, not able to pay our bills,” Jerome Roberts, a dishwasher at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor said in a statement. “Going on strike is hard, but not nearly as hard as trying to get by on what we are getting paid. We told the bosses in our negotiations how much we are struggling right now but they didn’t care. We are on strike to make them pay.”
    

    
            Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions and more staff to help. The union is asking for a restoration of many of the pandemic-era cuts that hotels made, including daily room cleaning. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic but worker salaries have not reflected the comeback.
    

    
            The hotels are reportedly still open but guests are contending with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services.
    

    
            “We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of Unite Here, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
    

    
            The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,776 rooms between them in the cities of Baltimore, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
    

    
            The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
    

    
            Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
    

    
            Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
    

    
            These strikes are set to end after three days.
